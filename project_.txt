platform: python flet   , 

APP    :IOT device borrow  platform  

Considering I am IOT student and we always rent the devices from the school ,but it always depend on the paper mark .  
I think the good idea is developing a system or web platform to make it almost automatically .
so, I determined to create a platform for this.
you guys can build the from work 
(jiancai hou :I will build the database for my data manager course , so do not follow my topic if any one has the data manager course )


function :  

login page , device_category_page,  order list page , current devices  list page,   history list  page 

login page :  student  and manager can login the main page the same time .  but student use student card number and manager use the staff card number .
they can use the card number and their password to login in   

device_category_page:  show all of devices  the school have  ,  and you can order the device  you want ,

order  list page  :  can order the different  devices  and  make order , has decision button  and cancel button 

current devices  list page  : can  check  the list of  borrowed  list but returning 

history list  page :  the list of  borrowed  and returned  

page design logic:

1. when  login in ,  first page is  device_category  page , there are list or table  show all of devices  the school have.  

2 help modify the device_category , which tableÂ´s row has a check box or some other box ,  the users  can choice  
and when click it will into the Order page , and Order page show what we prepare to  order, show the order in table list 

3.OrderPage  has a cancel  and order button , when click the order button , the data will add in the dababase :
select * from  rental_transaction

complex function (maybe in future we can achieve ) :

1.  device list and number ,  when borrow or return ,  the list page will update ,

other command , you can ignore :

npm init -y
npm install express mysql body-parser
node server.js 
npm install MySQL   or  npm install mysql2
npm install express
npm install cors
npm install bcrypt
 


record:
http://localhost:62808/#/order
